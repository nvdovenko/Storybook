# Introduction

Hi!

Welcome to my mini Storybook with React components and other features that I developed during my **TypeScript + design systems** study. Hope it highlights my progress and knowledge! ðŸ™‚

This Storybook includes several **classic UI components** such as:

- Button
- Checkbox
- Dropdown menu
- Input field
- Toggle button

And some components for **data visualization**:

- Bar chart
- Pie chart
- Radial gauge

It also has examples of:

- **Color library** with a copy name function
- **Icon library** with search and copy-to-clipboard function
- Small **typography** examples
